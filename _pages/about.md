I am a postdoc at [Vertaix](https://vertaix.princeton.edu/) and the Computer Science department of Princeton University, working with [Prof. Adji Bousso Dieng](https://adjiboussodieng.org/).
I obtained my Ph.D. in Computer Science from [McKelvey School of Engineering at Washington University in St. Louis](https://engineering.wustl.edu/mckelvey/Pages/default.aspx), advised by [Prof. Roman Garnett](https://www.cse.wustl.edu/~garnett/).
I was also briefly advised by [Prof. Sanmay Das](https://www.cse.wustl.edu/~sanmay/) while he was at WashU.
My research interests are in Bayesian machine learning, active search, and general decision-making under uncertainty to accelerate and automate scientific discovery.

I am also an avid programmer and a Python enthusiast.
Aside from research, I often write about data science, scientific computing, and Python programming.

My CV, last updated in October 2025, can be found [here](http://KrisNguyen135.github.io/files/quan_cv.pdf).
My research statement can be found [here](http://KrisNguyen135.github.io/files/quan_research_statement.pdf).
