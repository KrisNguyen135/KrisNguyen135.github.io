I am a third-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the [McKelvey School of Engineering at Washington University in St. Louis](https://engineering.wustl.edu/mckelvey/Pages/default.aspx), advised by [Prof. Roman Garnett](https://www.cse.wustl.edu/~garnett/).
I was also briefly advised by [Prof. Sanmay Das](https://www.cse.wustl.edu/~sanmay/) while he was at WashU.
Prior to this, I received a double degree in Computer Science and Mathematics, with a minor in Philosophy from [DePauw University](http://depauw.edu/).
My research interests are in Bayesian machine learning, active search, and decision-making under uncertainty.

I am also an avid programmer and a Python enthusiast.
Aside from research, I often write about data science, scientific computing, and Python programming.
I am currently working on the second version of the [Advanced Python Programming](https://www.packtpub.com/product/advanced-python-programming/9781838551216) book.

My CV, last updated in August 2021, can be found [here](http://KrisNguyen135.github.io/files/CV.pdf).
