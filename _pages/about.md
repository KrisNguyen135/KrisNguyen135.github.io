I am currently a first-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the [McKelvey School of Engineering at Washington University in St. Louis](https://engineering.wustl.edu/mckelvey/Pages/default.aspx), co-advised by [Prof. Sanmay Das](https://www.cse.wustl.edu/~sanmay/) and [Prof. Roman Garnett](https://www.cse.wustl.edu/~garnett/). Prior to this, I received a double degree in Computer Science and Mathematics, with a minor in Philosophy from [DePauw University](http://depauw.edu/). My research interests are in algorithm design and decision-making theory under uncertainty, and my current research centers around fairness in AI and machine learning systems.

I am also an avid programmer and a Python enthusiast. Aside from research, I often write about data science, scientific computing, and Python programming.

My CV, last updated in January 2020, can be found [here](http://KrisNguyen135.github.io/files/CV.pdf).

Though not a student at the school, I was introduced to and am a fan of the __Reasonable Person Principle__ at the School of Computer Science at CMU:
- Everyone will be reasonable.
- Everyone expects everyone else to be reasonable.
- No one is special.
- Do not be offended if someone suggests you are not being reasonable.

# Recent news

__March 2020__: I had a great time meeting our prospective students on visiting day at WashU. Check out our Ph.D. programs in [Computer Science](https://cse.wustl.edu/graduate/programs/Pages/phd-programs.aspx) and [Computational & Data Sciences](https://datasciences.wustl.edu/) if you are considering doing a PhD.

__March 2020__: Another online learning project that I took part in designing just got published: the [Python Security Micro Degree](https://codered.eccouncil.org/Microdegrees/MicrodegreeDetails/Python-Security-Micro-Degree) from EC-Council. (The prominent Python programming author [Cody Jackson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cojackson) was part of the team.)

__February 2020__: I'm excited to announce that the online course that I've been designing for the past couple of months, [Deep learning with Google Colab](https://www.udemy.com/course/deep-learning-with-google-colab/), has recently been published on Udemy.

__January 2020__: I'm extremely honored to officially start a joint Ph.D. advisorship with [Prof. Sanmay Das](https://www.cse.wustl.edu/~sanmay/) and [Prof. Roman Garnett](https://www.cse.wustl.edu/~garnett/).

__December 2019__: I was selected to serve on the [Liberman Graduate Center Advisory Committee](https://graduateschool.wustl.edu/liberman-center) at WashU.

# Current projects

Aside from research, a few miscellaneous activities I'm engaged in at the moment are:

- I am part of a team currently designing and teaching a workshop named _Python Mathematics_, which discusses mathematics and scientific computing techniques in Python. The project is a collaboration between [Packt Publishing](https://www.packtpub.com/) and [Global Knowledge](https://www.globalknowledge.com/).
- I am in the process of reworking the website for the [CSE departmentâ€™s Graduate Student Association](https://www.cse.wustl.edu/csegsa/) at WashU. Suggestions are most welcomed!
- I am currently working on a [pure-white 1000-piece jigsaw puzzle](https://www.amazon.com.au/worlds-smallest-Jigsaw-White-hell-M71-847/dp/B008DCQE3O).
