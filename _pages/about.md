I am currently a first-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the [McKelvey School of Engineering at Washington University in St. Louis] (https://engineering.wustl.edu/mckelvey/Pages/default.aspx). Prior to this, I received a B.A. dual degree in Computer Science and Mathematics, with a minor in Philosophy from [DePauw University](http://depauw.edu/).
