I am a forth-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the [McKelvey School of Engineering at Washington University in St. Louis](https://engineering.wustl.edu/mckelvey/Pages/default.aspx), advised by [Prof. Roman Garnett](https://www.cse.wustl.edu/~garnett/).
I was also briefly advised by [Prof. Sanmay Das](https://www.cse.wustl.edu/~sanmay/) while he was at WashU.
Prior to this, I received a double degree in Computer Science and Mathematics, with a minor in Philosophy from [DePauw University](http://depauw.edu/).
My research interests are in Bayesian machine learning, active search, and general decision-making under uncertainty to accelerate and automate scientific discovery.

I am also an avid programmer and a Python enthusiast.
Aside from research, I often write about data science, scientific computing, and Python programming.
I am currently working on the [Bayesian Optimization in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/bayesian-optimization-in-action) book.

My CV, last updated in November 2022, can be found [here](http://KrisNguyen135.github.io/files/CV.pdf).

# Recent news

__December 2022__: I'm excited to be at NeurIPS 2022 to present our paper on a novel way of doing [_local Bayesian optimization_](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11662), which was selected as an oral!


__December 2022__: I had an amazing time speaking at this year's [PyData Global](https://pydata.org/global2022) on using Bayesian optimization in practice.
Most of the content was adopted my book [Bayesian Optimization in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/bayesian-optimization-in-action).

__November 2022__: We released a new [preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13066) on modeling the mixing thermodynamics of high-entropy alloys.

__July 2022__: I'm very happy to be again selected to receive the Honors distinction from the CSE department at WashU for exemplary Ph.D. research performance.

__February 2022__: We released a new [preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03593) on _multi-class active search_ for diverse discovery tasks.
This work develops a machine learning method of uncovering a diverse set of targets among a large pool of unlabeled data.
