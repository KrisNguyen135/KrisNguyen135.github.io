I am a third-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the [McKelvey School of Engineering at Washington University in St. Louis](https://engineering.wustl.edu/mckelvey/Pages/default.aspx), advised by [Prof. Roman Garnett](https://www.cse.wustl.edu/~garnett/).
I was also briefly advised by [Prof. Sanmay Das](https://www.cse.wustl.edu/~sanmay/) while he was at WashU.
Prior to this, I received a double degree in Computer Science and Mathematics, with a minor in Philosophy from [DePauw University](http://depauw.edu/).
My research interests are in Bayesian machine learning, active search, and general decision-making under uncertainty to accelerate and automate scientific discovery.

I am also an avid programmer and a Python enthusiast.
Aside from research, I often write about data science, scientific computing, and Python programming.
I am currently working on the second edition of the [Advanced Python Programming](https://www.packtpub.com/product/advanced-python-programming/9781838551216) book.

My CV, last updated in November 2021, can be found [here](http://KrisNguyen135.github.io/files/CV.pdf).

# Recent news

__November 2021__: Our paper on using _active search_ to discover photoswitches with high light absorbance was accepted to the _Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling_!

__October 2021__: I had an amazing time speaking at this year's [PyData Global](https://pydata.org/global2021) on using Bayesian optimization on preference learning with pairwise comparisons.

__October 2021__: My advisor [Roman Garnett](https://www.cse.wustl.edu/~garnett/) released a preliminary draft of [his book on Bayesian optimization](https://bayesoptbook.com/). It's a great resource on the topic; plus, the plots are pretty!

__July 2021__: I was selected to receive the Honors distinction from the CSE department at WashU for exemplary Ph.D. research performance.

__July 2021__: I had a great time meeting with the students from the BrightPath STEAM Academy and talking about my research on Bayesian machine learning for automating scientific discovery.
