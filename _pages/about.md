I am currently a first-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the [McKelvey School of Engineering at Washington University in St. Louis](https://engineering.wustl.edu/mckelvey/Pages/default.aspx), co-advised by [Prof. Sanmay Das](https://www.cse.wustl.edu/~sanmay/) and [Prof. Roman Garnett](https://www.cse.wustl.edu/~garnett/). Prior to this, I received a double degree in Computer Science and Mathematics, with a minor in Philosophy from [DePauw University](http://depauw.edu/). My research interests are in algorithm design and decision-making theory under uncertainty, and my current research centers around fairness in AI and machine learning systems.

I am also an avid programmer and a Python enthusiast. Aside from research, I often write about data science, scientific computing, and Python programming.

My CV, last updated in March 2020, can be found [here](http://KrisNguyen135.github.io/files/CV.pdf).

# Recent news

__March 2020__: I had a great time meeting our prospective students on visiting day at WashU. Check out our Ph.D. programs in [Computer Science](https://cse.wustl.edu/graduate/programs/Pages/phd-programs.aspx) and [Computational & Data Sciences](https://datasciences.wustl.edu/) if you are considering doing a PhD.

__March 2020__: Another online learning project that I took part in designing just got published: the [Python Security Micro Degree](https://codered.eccouncil.org/Microdegrees/MicrodegreeDetails/Python-Security-Micro-Degree) from EC-Council. (The prominent Python programming author [Cody Jackson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cojackson) was part of the team.)

__February 2020__: I'm excited to announce that the online course that I've been designing for the past couple of months, [Deep learning with Google Colab](https://www.udemy.com/course/deep-learning-with-google-colab/), has recently been published on Udemy.

__January 2020__: I'm extremely honored to officially start a joint Ph.D. advisorship with [Prof. Sanmay Das](https://www.cse.wustl.edu/~sanmay/) and [Prof. Roman Garnett](https://www.cse.wustl.edu/~garnett/).

__December 2019__: I was selected to serve on the [Liberman Graduate Center Advisory Committee](https://graduateschool.wustl.edu/liberman-center) at WashU.

# Miscellaneous projects

Aside from research, a few miscellaneous activities I'm engaged in at the moment are:

- I am currently involved in designing and teaching two workshops, _Statistics and Calculus with Python_ and _Reinforcement Learning with Python_. These projects belong to an overarching collaboration between [Packt Publishing](https://www.packtpub.com/) and [Global Knowledge](https://www.globalknowledge.com/).
- Though I only have time during weekends for it now, [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) has been a running interest for me. If you are on the platform, feel free to connect using my friend code: __970089_IFFiOeWo2ASm1HPTOpVp3tvIiiJfhQuV__.
- I am reading through the online book [Bayesian Methods for Hackers](https://camdavidsonpilon.github.io/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers/). Definitely give it a try if you are interested in Bayesian statistics and PyMC3.

# Quotes

Here are some fun quotes/sayings I've collected through the years:

"All truth is one.
<br/>
In this light, may science and religion endeavor together for the steady evolution of Mankind:
<br/>
From darkness to light,
<br/>
From narrowness to broadmindedness,
<br/>
From prejudice to tolerance,
<br/>
It is the voice of life that calls us
<br/>
To come and learn."
<br/>
-- _Anonymous_ (_Quoted by Cliff Stoll at the Embedded Systems Conference 2000._)

CMU's Reasonable Person Principle (RPP):
- Everyone will be reasonable.
- Everyone expects everyone else to be reasonable.
- No one is special.
- Do not be offended if someone suggests you are not being reasonable.

"You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means."
<br/>
-- Inigo Montoya, _The Princess Bride_ (1987) (Used in Morey, R., Hoekstra, R., Rouder, J., Lee, M., & Wagenmakers, E.-J. (2015). The fallacy of placing confidence in confidence intervals. Psychonomic Bulletin & Review, 1â€“21.)

Folk Theorem of Statistical Computing:
<br/>
_If you are having computational problems, probably your model is wrong._
