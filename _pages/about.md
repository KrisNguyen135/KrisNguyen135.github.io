I am currently a first-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the [McKelvey School of Engineering at Washington University in St. Louis](https://engineering.wustl.edu/mckelvey/Pages/default.aspx). Prior to this, I received a dual degree in Computer Science and Mathematics, with a minor in Philosophy from [DePauw University](http://depauw.edu/). My research interests are in algorithm design and decision-making theory under uncertainty.

I am also an avid programmer and a Python enthusiast. Aside from research, I often write about data science, scientific computing, and Python programming.

My CV, last updated in November 2019, can be found [here](http://KrisNguyen135.github.io/files/CV.pdf).

A few miscellaneous activities I'm engaged in at the moment:

- I am part of a team currently designing and teaching a workshop named _Python Mathematics_, which discusses mathematic and scientific computing techniques in Python. The project is a collaboration between [Packt Publishing](https://www.packtpub.com/) and [Global Knowledge](https://www.globalknowledge.com/).
- I am in the process of reworking the website for the [CSE departmentâ€™s Graduate Student Association](https://www.cse.wustl.edu/csegsa/) at WashU. Suggestions are most welcomed!
- I am currently working on a [pure-white 1000-piece jigsaw puzzle](https://www.amazon.com.au/worlds-smallest-Jigsaw-White-hell-M71-847/dp/B008DCQE3O).

Though not a student at the school, I was recently introduced to the __Reasonable Person Principle__ at the School of Computer Science at CMU and fully endorse it. It follows:
- Everyone will be reasonable.
- Everyone expects everyone else to be reasonable.
- No one is special.
- Do not be offended if someone suggests you are not being reasonable.
