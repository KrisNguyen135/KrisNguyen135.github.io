I am a forth-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the [McKelvey School of Engineering at Washington University in St. Louis](https://engineering.wustl.edu/mckelvey/Pages/default.aspx), advised by [Prof. Roman Garnett](https://www.cse.wustl.edu/~garnett/).
I was also briefly advised by [Prof. Sanmay Das](https://www.cse.wustl.edu/~sanmay/) while he was at WashU.
Prior to this, I received a double degree in Computer Science and Mathematics, with a minor in Philosophy from [DePauw University](http://depauw.edu/).
My research interests are in Bayesian machine learning, active search, and general decision-making under uncertainty to accelerate and automate scientific discovery.

I am also an avid programmer and a Python enthusiast.
Aside from research, I often write about data science, scientific computing, and Python programming.
I am currently working on the [Bayesian Optimization in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/bayesian-optimization-in-action) book.

My CV, last updated in May 2023, can be found [here](http://KrisNguyen135.github.io/files/CV.pdf).
